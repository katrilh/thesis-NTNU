\chapter*{Abstract}

In tandem with an increase in devices that can detect and store motion data, the interest in analyzing this type of data has grown.
Computing similarity distance is crucial for all types of analysis, and for trajectory data, there are several algorithms that compute it.  

In this thesis, we theoretically and experimentally investigate seven different similarity distance measures.
The theoretical part of the thesis examines different notions of trajectory similarly and relates it back to the trajectory data format. 
The experimental part of the thesis is focused on how the theory unfolds in practice.
We analyze a data set of arbitrary trajectories. 
The analysis emphasizes how the different algorithms use different notions of similarity.
